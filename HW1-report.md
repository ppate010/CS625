## Git, GitHub

* <em> What is the URL of the GitHub repo that you created in your personal account? </em>
  
My personal GitHub repo for this assignment is located at: https://github.com/ppate010/CS625

* <em> What is pull vs clone in GitHub? </em>
  
Clone: Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of a remote repository on your local computer. It will download all files and commits from the remote to your local computer. 

Pull: Pulling is used when your local repo is setup it will fetch and merge changes from the remote repository into your local branch. 

* You have committed a change on your local machine/remote. However, you want to undo the changes committed. How would you do that?

If you committed a change and would like to undo the change committed the command to use would be git revert <commit-hash>.

## Markdown

 <em> Create a bulleted list with at least 3 items </em>
 
* Pokemon
* Yugioh
* Digimon

The paragraph must explain your favorite Olympic sport/game, the country that won the most number of olympic GOLD medals (Summer) in your favorite sport in 2020 (Japan) and 2024 (France).

My favorite Olympic sport is ***Judo*** which I personally find super exciting to watch. In 2020, ***<em>Japan</em>*** received the most gold medal in 'Judo' but in 2024 *France* took the lead and claimed the most gold medals.
