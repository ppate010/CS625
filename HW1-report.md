 ### What is pull vs clone in GitHub?
**Clone**: Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of a remote repository on your local computer. It will download all files and commits from the remote to your local computer.

**Pull**: Pulling is used when your local repo is setup it will fetch and merge changes from the remote repository into your local branch.

<em> You have committed a change on your local machine/remote. However, you want to undo the changes committed. How would you do that? </em>
