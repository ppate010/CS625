## Git, GitHub
* What is the URL of the GitHub repo that you created in your personal account? 
My personal GitHub repo for this assignment is located at: https://github.com/ppate010/CS625

* <em> What is pull vs clone in GitHub? </em>
  
Clone: Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of a remote repository on your local computer. It will download all files and commits from the remote to your local computer. 

*Pull: Pulling is used when your local repo is setup it will fetch and merge changes from the remote repository into your local branch. 

* You have committed a change on your local machine/remote. However, you want to undo the changes committed. How would you do that?
